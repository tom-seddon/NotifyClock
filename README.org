For a long time I've been using Windows with a vertical taskbar.
Compared to the default horizontal orientation, you can have a lot
more windows on screen before Windows has to merge icons or hide the
window title. 

The Windows clock takes up a lot of space in this mode though.

You can hide it... but now you've got no clock.

=NotifyClock= fixes this by displaying a tiny little clock in the
notification area (aka system tray). It shows two numbers: at the top,
the hour (in 24H format), and at the bottom, the minute.

If you forget the date, hover over the icon to get a tooltip.

To copy the current date and time to the clipboard, right click the
icon and select =Copy= from the menu. The date and time copied is
always of the form YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.

To exit, right click the icon and select =Exit= from the menu.

* Download

1. Get the EXE direct from the repo - [[https://github.com/tom-seddon/NotifyClock/blob/master/NotifyClock_Release_x86.exe][=NotifyClock_Release_x86.exe=]],
   click =Download=.

2. Copy it into your startup folder. (To find that, use Win+R, then
   enter =shell:startup=.)

3. Run it from there once. It isn't signed, so on first run you may
   have to click through some prompts.

Only tested on Windows 10 so far, but I told Visual Studio to build
for Windows 8.1, so... who knows?
